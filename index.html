        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I was born in North Carolina, but mostly raised in Virginia. Portland is where I have been living for the past twelve years, but out in nature is where I feel at home -- not to say I don't also enjoy modern creature comforts and watching the Trail Blazers on a big screen at my local sports bar! It's also worth noting that I love sweet potatoes.</p>
